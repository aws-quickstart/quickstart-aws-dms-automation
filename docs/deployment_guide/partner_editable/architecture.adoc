image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/image2.png[Architecture]

The Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones*
* In the private subnets:

* CodeBuild to deploy code into the target Amazon RDS database
* An AWS DMS replication instance*

* AWS DMS endpoints for migrating data and replicating on-going changes from source to target**
* A versioned S3 bucket, used as a source to trigger AWS CodePipeline
* Amazon SNS, which streams CodePipeline and AWS DMS events to Lambda and to the end user over email
* Parameter Store for storing the CodePipeline execution token.

* The default is not to create a new replication instance, but you have the option to create one.

** The template will prompt you for your existing AWS DMS resource configuration.
